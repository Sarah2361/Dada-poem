    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.
      </li>

      const article = `An official comes over and gives both you and Dani a signal to follow them.  
You hoist your tennis bag onto your back and follow Dani down the hallway.  
The hallway is lined with photos of previous champions; each one you pass becoming more recent than the previous photo.  
You can start to hear the noise from the crowd, which fills you with about 20% excitement and the remaining 80% pure angst.  
Youve been in this position before, and it devastated you when it didn’t go your way. You don't want a repeat of that. Over a billion different thoughts fly through your brain before you near the entrance to the court. Each step forwards filling you with angst that intensifies with each step. Time seems to slowdown in these few remaining seconds before you step out in front of the crowd. The noise from outside is now like a swarm of bees hovering just in front of you.`;
